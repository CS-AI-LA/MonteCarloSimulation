Monte Carlo Simulation (Python | Probabilistic Modeling)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to model and analyze stochastic systems using Python. The simulation leverages repeated random sampling to estimate outcome distributions and quantify uncertainty in scenarios where analytical solutions are impractical.

The notebook (train.ipynb) follows a structured ML-style workflow: defining probabilistic inputs, executing large-scale simulations, aggregating results, and visualizing statistical behavior. Emphasis is placed on efficient numerical computation, reproducibility, and interpretation of uncertainty.

Why This Matters

Monte Carlo techniques are widely used in machine learning, quantitative finance, risk analysis, and scientific computing. This project showcases the ability to translate theoretical probabilistic concepts into efficient, practical code and to interpret results in a data-driven manner—skills directly relevant to applied ML and data science roles.
